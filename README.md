**Geo Inspector** is a web-based tool designed to help developers and network engineers analyze API performance and behavior from multiple geographical locations. It simulates API requests from different countries, measures response latency, and uses Generative AI to analyze responses for potential geolocation-specific clues.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Multi-Location Inspection**: Test any API endpoint from a list of global locations simultaneously.
- **Country-Based Selection**: Easily select target geolocations by country name.
- **Latency Measurement**: Get the response time in milliseconds for each request.
- **Detailed API Response**: View the full HTTP status, headers, and body for each location's response.
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Leverage Genkit and Google's Gemini model to automatically analyze responses for subtle geolocation clues.
- **Result Exporting**: 
  - Download a summary of results in a clean, table-formatted **PDF**, complete with your app logo.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/geo-inspector.git
    cd geo-inspector
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    The application uses Google's Generative AI for analysis. You'll need a Gemini API key.

    - Create a `.env` file in the root of the project by copying the example file:
      ```bash
      cp .env.example .env
      ```
    - Open the newly created `.env` file and add your Gemini API key:
      ```
      GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE
      ```
    - You can get a Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This command runs the Next.js app on `http://localhost:9002` by default.

2.  **Open your browser:**
    Navigate to [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) to see the application.
